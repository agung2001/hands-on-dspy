DSPy is a framework for algorithmically optimizing LM prompts and weights 
to solve knowledge-intensive tasks. It provides a unified interface for 
programming with foundation models, fine-tuning smaller models, and 
optimizing prompts and pipelines. DSPy introduces a new paradigm for 
programming with language models, focusing on declarative signatures, 
composable modules, and optimizable programs.
